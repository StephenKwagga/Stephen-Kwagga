# Stephen Kwagga

ML Engineer & Data Scientist
Building end-to-end machine learning solutions that turn raw data into real decisions. From time series forecasting, fraud detection, to patient segmentation, churn prediction, and marketing intelligence — I work across the full ML lifecycle: data wrangling, model development, deployment, and beyond. Cloud-native on AWS, version-controlled on GitHub, and always shipping.
